Data Science Projects
Thank you for taking the time to review my Data Analyst Portfolio. I am excited to present my diverse range of projects that highlight my proficiency in data analytics and my ability to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.

Having spent seven years as a frontend developer, I bring a unique perspective to data analysis, combining a strong foundation in programming with a keen eye for design and user experience. This background has allowed me to not only excel in the technical aspects of data analytics but also to communicate findings effectively through visually appealing dashboards and reports.

As I transition into the field of data science, I am currently pursuing a master's degree at the University of Sussex. This academic journey has deepened my theoretical understanding of data science principles, enhanced my statistical knowledge, and provided hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools and technologies used in the industry.

Despite my limited prior experience in data science, I have demonstrated my ability to leverage my programming and analytical skills to tackle real-world problems.

I take pride in my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, honed through years of frontend development. This strategic mindset allows me to approach data analysis with a goal-oriented perspective, identifying key issues and opportunities to drive informed decision-making.

I am confident that my unique combination of frontend development experience and current pursuit of a master's in data science positions me as a well-rounded candidate for data analyst roles.
